# Setup

  * Run npm install
  * run the db schema and seeds file in your mySql database
  * Edit the connection.js to update your username and password

# Purpose
This website is the introduction to handlebars for me.  Using handlebars to create unordered lists on the fly is a grate way to get out of having to create the json objects through javascript to append to the page.
